# ‚Ñπ About
Windows application for better organization of music downloaded using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).

# ‚è¨ Download
The program is free to download at this link:
* [Download msi installer here](https://github.com/jakubkastner/youtube2music/releases/download/0.0.1/youtube2music_installer.msi)

# üîç How program works
* Add a link to a YouTube video or playlist or YouTube Music Album.
* The program retrieves information about the videos (channel name, video name, video release date).
* youtube2music will try to get the artist, song title and featured artists from the video information.
* If an artist has already been found in your library, the program will automatically retrieve the genre, folder and new file name.
* You can then edit this information as you wish.
* If a song has already been found in your music library, the program will notify you.
* If you add an album, the program will try to find album information (artist, release year, playlist, cover) using Deezer API. 
* Once you have filled in all the necessary information about the videos, you can download them via youtube-dl (youtube2music does not download any videos - everything is furnished using this external program).
* The program then downloads the mp3 videos to your mp3 music library and uses ffmpeg to convert them to opus and save them to your opus music library.
* After downloading, you can still check the files in the mp3tag and add additional information if necessary.
